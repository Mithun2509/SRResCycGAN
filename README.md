# Deep Cyclic Generative Adversarial Residual Convolutional Networks for Real Image Super-Resolution (SRResCycGAN)
An official PyTorch implementation of the [SRResCycGAN](https://github.com/RaoUmer/SRResCycGAN) network as described in the paper [Deep Cyclic Generative Adversarial Residual Convolutional Networks for Real Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/). This work is participated in the [AIM 2020 Real-Image Super-resolution](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/aim20/) challenge track-3 at the high x4 upscaling factor.

The Code will be released soon.
